> **PLEASE NOTE**
> 
> The Azure Cosmos DB data migration tool is undergoing a full refactor to restructure the project to accomplish the following:
>
> - Provide a base cross-platform CLI that is lightweight and serves as the base (core) executable for hosting extensions
> - The extensible framework enables the community to add source and destination targets without modifying the core executable
> - Improve stability
> - Use the latest stable .NET release (currently .NET 6)
> - Use the latest Azure Cosmos DB SDKs

To access the archived version of the tool, navigate to the [**Archive branch**](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-datamigrationtool/tree/archive).
