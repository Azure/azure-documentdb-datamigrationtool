# Testing

This project includes a suite of unit and functional tests for each source and sink. These tests can be ran in the latest version of [Microsoft Visual Studio][visual-studio].

## Unit Tests

The project ships with a suite of unit tests that can be ran immediately on a clean fork of this repository. Running the unit tests do not require any additional configuration.

## Functional Tests

When you run all tests, in Visual Studio you may notice that most of the functional tests are marked as **inconclusive** with a status message. The functional tests require you to configure a **.runsettings** file in each project to run the tests in an end-to-end environment.

Each functional test project has a **.runsettings** in the root. The settings file includes an empty value for the corresponding data platform's connection string. If this value is empty, the test runner will automatically mark any functional test that requires a live data platform as **inconclusive**. If you provide a connection string, the test runner will use that connection string to connect to the live data platform.

> ðŸ’¡ The **.runsettings** file includes tips and examples on how to configure each data platform.

### DocumentDb (Azure Cosmos DB SQL API)

The [Azure Cosmos DB emulator][azure-cosmos-db-emulator] is the simplest way to run the functional tests for the DocumentDb source and sinks. The emulator can be installed on your local machine and ran like any other desktop application.

After the emulator is running, update the **Microsoft.DataTransfer.DocumentDb.FunctionalTests/.runsettings** file with the following connection string:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RunSettings>
    <TestRunParameters>
        <Parameter name="DocumentDbConnectionString" value="AccountEndpoint=https://localhost:8081;AccountKey=C2y6yDjf5/R+ob0N8A7Cgv30VRDJIWEHLM+4QDU5DE2nQ9nDuVTqobD4b8mGGyPMbIZnqyMsEcaGQy67XIw/Jw==;" />
    </TestRunParameters>
</RunSettings>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Azure Cosmos DB has a default static value for the account endpoint and key when using the emulator. [Read more about the default credentials][azure-cosmos-db-emulator-credentials].

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you include a semi-colon at the end of your connection string.

### MongoDb

The simplest way to run the functional tests for Mongo, would be to use the **[mongo][mongo-docker]** container image from Docker Hub. To start a new mongo instance in a Docker installation:

```bash
docker pull mongo
docker run --detach --publish 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then, update the **Microsoft.DataTransfer.MongoDb.FunctionalTests/.runsettings** file with the following connection string:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RunSettings>
    <TestRunParameters>
        <Parameter name="MongoConnectionString" value="mongodb://localhost:27017" />
    </TestRunParameters>
</RunSettings>
```

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you do not include a trailing slash with your connection string.
